1. NO_NETWORK_POLICY - 	The misconfiguration category that is related with not specifying network policies. 
		       	Without specifying network policies Kubernetes installations are susceptible to 
		       	unauthorized accesses.

2. NO_ROLLING_UPDATE - 	The misconfiguration category that is related with not explicitly specifying 
			RollingUpdate in the configuration file. A lack of rolling updates makes a 
			Kubernetes installation susceptible to supply chain related attacks.

3. INSECURE_HTTP - 	The category of using HTTP without SSL/TLS certificates to setup URLs or
			transmit traffic inside and outside the Kubernetes clusters. Without SSL/TLS 
			certificates, the data transmitted across Kubernetes objects are susceptible 
			to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
